            <p style = "color:rgb(157, 255, 0);"> The speed reducers are an effective way to prevent car crashes 
                and I want to research on whether the amount of speed reducers 
                in each borough effects the amount of car crashes. I will use 
                various methods and equations to find average car crashes and 
                number of car crashes in relation to number of speed reducers 
                in every borough. This is a problem because speed reducers are 
                a major way to stop crashes from happening, and the data for 
                this project can help evaluate the possibility whether, having 
                more speed reducers effects crash rate.</p>

            to better understand the relation between car crashes and amount of speed reducers.<br><br>
                Some of these Analysis can be:
                <br><br><br>

        File 1: Counts and Percentage based on Borough (created using Join of both Data sets)
        Distinct Borough Name, count of car crashes per borough, count of speed reducers per borough, a percentage of totalcrash/totalreducer.<br><br>

        File 2: Counts and Percentage Based on Street (created using Join of both Data sets)
        Distinct Borough Name, Street Name, count of car crashes per street, count of speed reducers per street, a percentage of totalcrash/totalreducer.<br><br>

        File 2 extended: Displays ALL the streets that need more reducers because of above average crash rate, done by first calcuating the mean 
        crash total and then comparing with each street <br><br>

        File 2 extended: Displays ALL the streets that dont need more reducers because of below average crash rate, done by first calcuating the mean 
        crash total and then comparing with each street <br><br>

        File 3: This File displays the streetName, Lat and Lon of all the reducers that have caused accidents, analyzed through checking all the 
        latitute and longitute of reducers and car crashes that match <br><br>

                This File displays: <br><br>
                1) The Borough Names for each street <br><br>
                2) All the Street Names from each borough <br><br>
                3) The number of crashes per street <br><br>
                4) The number of reducers per street <br><br>
                5) The ratio of crashes/reducers <br><br>


                <br><br>
                There was not much pattern seen, in whether number of crashes per borough is affected by the number of reducers in that borough<br><br>
                However, it was noticed that, Manhattan has the highest crash/reducer ratio out of all the boroughs

                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                There was a partial pattern noticed in the borough of Manhattan as observed in the previous File, the ratio was the largest.<br><br>
                The streets in Manhattan with the least reducers have a large amount of crashes.
                <br><br><br>
                As will be seen in the next outcomes, the mean rash/recuder ratio, will help analyze the street crashes further.

            and crashes that are viewed thorugh a join statement. This helps us to see which crashes occurerd in the places that 
            have reducers, allowing us to understand that, the crash could have been caused by the reducer. This can further help us to understand whether
            the reducer is necessary in that certain position</p><br><br>
