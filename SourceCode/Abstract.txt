Title: Crash Reducer Evaluation
Theme: Transport, Health, Urban
Abstract: My approach for this project is to make an analysis of relation between crashes and speed reducers in NYC. I am doing this by joining both datasets in order to filter data and display it. This data will help in analyzing the relations.
Relevance to NYC: This is related to NYC because  it focus on all the crashes and speed reducers in all the 5 boroughs.
